      <p>SCNA welcomes any current or aspiring software developers, entrepreneurs, small business owners, development managers, and technology professionals interested in improving their craft, their community, and themselves. We’d love to have you, no matter how broad your interests and experiences.</p>

      <p>What! Software development is not some “boys’ club”; we like to think of SCNA as an “everyone club.”</p>
